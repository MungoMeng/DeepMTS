# AAN: Appearance Adjustment Network for Medical Image Registration
In this study, we introduced the concept of multi-task leaning into deep survival models to address the overfitting problem resulted from small data. Tumor segmentation was incorporated as an auxiliary task to enhance the modelâ€™s efficiency of learning from scarce medical imaging data. Based on this idea, we proposed a 3D end-to-end Deep Multi-Task Survival model (DeepMTS) for joint survival prediction and tumor segmentation. Our DeepMTS can jointly learn survival prediction and tumor segmentation using medical imaging data
